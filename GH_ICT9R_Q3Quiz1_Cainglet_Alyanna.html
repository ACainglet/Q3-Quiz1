				<p><center><i><div style ="color:darkcyan;">For me, this is the best Studio Ghibli film. The story, the art, the music, the voice acting, the dialogues... everything! It was so beautiful to watch, and I've never felt so many emotions for any other movie. The movie starts out by showing us how Kaguya-hime comes to being on earth, and follows her growing and navigating sudden riches and more wordly problems. I can't even put to words how amazing this movie is... they really knew how they were animating this film, from detailed scenes to completely raw sketches, it always imparts the right emotion. It's well-deserving of all the praise the movie gets! <3</i></center></p>

				<p><center><i><div style ="color: darkcyan;">I love this movie so much! Sophie has got to be one of my favourite protagonists of all time. (Maybe because I relate to her so much) She's nice and kind while still having a teasing and good sense of humour. She gets thrown into the situation by telling someone who was being rude to leave and she takes it in stride as she's suddenly an old woman, still helping people and making the best of her curse. All of the characters mesh so well together! It feels like I've watched an entire series worth of banter and conversations between them after I watch the movie. I crave more of it every time. The animation is beautiful, the landscapes, the moving airships, every close up of Sophie's face and all the lighting. I know I'll still be watching this movie for a very long time.</i></center></p>

				<p><center><i><div style ="color:darkcyan;">If you'd choose to ever see only one animated movie, this is it: Studio Ghibli's "Spirited Away" will prove it's boundless merits to you, starting with it's breathtaking, hand drawn presentation. Thru incredibly patient detail, Ghibli's artists bring to life everything from accurately portraying the feelings and physical movement of a young girl, to landscapes and environments full of detail that are so typical of the respect given by Japanese Shinto. But more importantly, the story in "Spirited Away" addresses the hallmark issues of modern Japan; issues which are incredibly human, and universal.</i></center></p>
